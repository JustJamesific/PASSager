# PASSager - Password Manager

## Description

This is a small Offline, Opensource and FREE Password Manager app that helps you to keep your passwords safe! Using AES Encryption to keep your passwords encrypted, your passwords are in safe hands!

## How to use?

1. First, download the source code and open it up in any code editor (VS Code Recomended).
   (NOTE: Python must be installed on the device!)
2. Then, run the 'Imports.py' file. This will download all the required packages required for it to work. if this doesn't work, then please install the required packages manually (`pip install *package name*`)
3. Once you run the imports file, go to the 'PASSager.py' file and run that as well. This will open up a window. Set a secure and strong Masterpassword for your account. (NOTE: Make sure to REMEMBER this password. If lost, your account cannot be recovered!)
4. After that, exit the app and run the 'PASSager.py' file again. And then done! You can now use the app by running the 'PASSager.py' file!
